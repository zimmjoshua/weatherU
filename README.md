# weatherU
iOS weather application. The application uses your current locationâ€™s GPS data and sends that latitude and longitude data to the openweathermaps servers thus grabbing the current weather data based on the current location. The application displays the current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and the current weather condition based on a condition code specified in the openweathermaps API documentation. The application also lets the user pick a city location and view that city's current weather conditions.
